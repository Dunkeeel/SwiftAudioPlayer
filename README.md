# SwiftAudioPlayer

![Screenshot](SwiftAudioPlayer.png)

This is my "Work in progress" audio player for macOS, written entirely in Swift.
It's just a little project of mine to learn more about swift and macOS app development, since I'm quite new to programming.

Any help and/or contribution for further development is greatly appreciated.
Let's make this a great and easy to use open source music player for macOS.

**!!! As of now this does not play any music. At the moment it's just some UI stuff. !!!**

## ToDo-List:
- make it possible to import audio files and display them in a list
- add ability to play imported files
- additional playlist management
- add more features and optimize the player itself
